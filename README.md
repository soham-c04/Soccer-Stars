# Soccer-Stars

This game is inspired by - [Soccer Stars by Miniclip](https://www.miniclip.com/games/soccer-stars)

This is a multiplayer - online and offline game made using the library **graphics.h**.

Check out [Air_Hockey from SAHAS-Arcade](https://github.com/soham-c04/SAHAS-Arcade) first.

See [this](https://github.com/soham-c04/SAHAS-Arcade/tree/main/How%20to%20Compile) to compile to locally.

## How to Play:-
1) Both players have 5 strikers each. Players can shoot the strikers by holding left click on any of their strikers and then releasing it. 
2) Initial turn to shoot the ball will be random.
3) There is a 90-sec timer before the game ends. The aim is to score more goals than your opponent.
4) More the distance the mouse is pulled backwards, higher the force with which the striker is shot (Like a slingshot). But, the strikers have a maximum speed and pulling the mouse further won't increase the speed any further.
5) The yellow line with arrow head shows the direction in which the striker will be shot if released from the current position.
6) Right-click to switch from current striker to choose another one.
7) After a player shoots, the next player gets to shoot the ball after all the strikers and the ball on field have stopped moving.
8) The pink arc around the strikers shows the time left for the player to shoot the ball. If it becomes 0 then the player runs out of time and the next player gets the turn to shoot.
9) Goaling in the first shot will be considered a foul and kick-off switches to other player.

**Note:-** Make sure to have the resources folder in the same directory as "Soccer Stars.exe".
