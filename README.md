### How to Play:-
1) Both players have 5 strikers each. Players can shoot the strikers by left clicking on any of their strikers and then releasing from that position. 
2) Initial turn to shoot the ball will be random.
3) More the distance the mouse is pulled backwards, higher the force with which the striker is shot (Like a slingshot). But, the strikers have a maximum velocity and pulling the mouse further won't increase the speed any further.
4) The yellow line with arrow head shows the direction in which the striker will be shot if released from the current position.
5) Right-click to switch from current striker to choose another one.
6) After a player shoots, the next player gets to shoot the ball after all the strikers and the ball on field have stopped moving.
7) The pink arc around the strikers shows the time left for the player to shoot the ball. If it becomes 0 then the player runs out of time and the next player gets the turn to shoot.
8) Goaling in the first shot will be considered a foul and kick-off switches to other player.
9) There is no winning condition.
